Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm William 'Eaglebranch' Ã–rnquist.<br>
I have a big interest in creating gameplay through programming, solving problems and putting pieces together.

I've lived my whole life playing and studying games of different genres and platforms,<br>
which has built up my vast understanding of what makes games enjoyable and accessible.

I'm currently most proficient at creating games through:
  - Unity Engine
  - MonoGame Engine
  - C#
  - XNA Framework
  
I also have basic knowledge in:
  - Unreal Engine
  - C++
  - Java
  - Web development
